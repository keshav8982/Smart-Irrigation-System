##  About the Project

The **Smart Irrigation System** is a hardware-based IoT project designed to automate the irrigation of agricultural fields by monitoring soil moisture levels. It ensures that crops are only watered when necessary, conserving water and improving crop yield without manual effort.

This project demonstrates how embedded systems and IoT can solve real-world agricultural problems, making farming more efficient, reliable, and sustainable.

##  Objectives

- Automate irrigation based on soil moisture levels.
- Reduce water wastage through precise control.
- Minimize human effort in agricultural monitoring.
- Improve agricultural productivity through optimized water management.

##  Hardware Components

| Component              | Quantity | Purpose                        |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| Arduino UNO             | 1        | Microcontroller (Main control)  |
| Soil Moisture Sensor    | 1-2      | Detects soil wetness/dryness    |
| Relay Module (5V)       | 1        | Controls the water pump         |
| Water Pump (12V)        | 1        | Provides irrigation             |
| 12V Battery / Adapter   | 1        | Power supply for components     |
| Breadboard / Jumper Wires | -      | Circuit connections             |

##  How It Works

1. The **Soil Moisture Sensor** continuously monitors the soil condition.
2. If the moisture level drops **below a defined threshold**, the **Arduino turns ON the water pump** via the Relay Module.
3. Once the soil moisture reaches an acceptable level, the **pump is automatically turned OFF**.
4. (Optional) Moisture data can be monitored remotely through platforms like **Blynk** or **ThingSpeak**.
